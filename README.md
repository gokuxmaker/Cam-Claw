The Cam Claw is designed to assist with a variety of outdoor activities. It can be employed to gently remove fruits and flowers located several feet up in a tree. plant , remove a shuttlecock wedged against a ceiling, or probe into dark and narrow places such as drains. You can see what the claw grabs in real time, courtesy of the incorporated camera, which presents the video feed right from the first-person perspective. It is also useful for nighttime activities or dark places thanks to the LED light.

The system is centred around an XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense microcontroller with an OV3660 camera. It uses a fully 3D printed servo-driven claw for gripping, and any mobile device for control over Wi-Fi. For this build, I mounted it on a 7-foot pole, but the lightweight design, along with the robust wireless connection, allows it to be mounted to poles over 20 feet without losing control or video feed.

Lightweight, compact, and easy to operate, the Cam Claw combines IoT-based wireless control, real-time video streaming, and mechanical gripping into a single outdoor-friendly tool that can be adapted for harvesting, object retrieval, or exploration.

So let's get into building

Note: There was a typo during the documentation of the app, "CAM CALW," which has been resolved in the program update.
